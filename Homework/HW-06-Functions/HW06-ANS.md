# HW06-ANS
# Problem 1
```matlab
Check_one = checkFactor(25, 6)
Check_two = checkFactor(9, 3)
Check_three = checkFactor(3, 9)
```
This section seems to be calling a function named `checkFactor` with different input arguments.

The function is likely designed to check if the second argument is a factor of the first argument.

The results are stored in variables `Check_one`, `Check_two`, and `Check_three`.
# Problem 2
```matlab
[output1, output2] = sumAndAverage([3 2 3 2])
[output3, output4] = sumAndAverage([5 -5 2 8 0])
[output5, output6] = sumAndAverage([])
```
This section calls a function named `sumAndAverage` with different arrays as input.

The function likely returns two outputs: the sum and average of the input array.

The results are stored in variables `output1`, `output2`, ..., `output6`.
# Problem 3
```matlab
[season1, wPercentage1] = teamRecord(3, 9)
[season2, wPercentage2] = teamRecord(10, 2)
```
This part is calling a function named `teamRecord` with different input arguments.

The function likely returns two outputs: the season number and the winning percentage.

The results are stored in variables `season1`, `wPercentage1`, `season2`, and `wPercentage2`.
# Problem 4
```matlab
[sumcolumns, sumrows, majordiagonal, minordiagonal] = multiSum([1 2 3 5; 4 5 6 6; 7 8 9 68])
[sumcolumns1, sumrows1, majordiagonal1, minordiagonal1] = multiSum([0 2 3; 4 0 6; 7 8 0])
```
This section is calling a function named `multiSum` with different matrices as input.

The function likely returns sums of columns, rows, major diagonal, and minor diagonal.

The results are stored in variables `sumcolumns`, `sumrows`, `majordiagonal`, `minordiagonal`, `sumcolumns1`, `sumrows1`, `majordiagonal1`, and `minordiagonal1`.
