
# Problem 1:

You are given two sides of a triangle,

|   $a$   |  4.5   |
|:-------:|:------:|
| **$b$** | **6**  |
| **$C$** | **35** |

where **`a`** and **`b`** are the lengths of the sides and **`C`** is the angle between them. Write a script to
find the length of the third side and the area of the triangle.

> \[!TIP]\
> know the law of cosines and the formula for the area of a triangle.

# Problem 2:

A batter in baseball makes perfect contact with the ball, sending it up at a ```45-degree``` angle toward the fence `400 feet` away.

**a.** Write a script to determine how fast he must hit the ball to land at the base of the fence, neglecting air
resistance.

**b.** Perform a brief experiment to determine whether there was a bet

> \[!TIP]\
> Distance = rate * time. The horizontal distance, D = the horizontal component of the rate * time, or using symbols,  $D = V*cos(45)t$.
The vertical distance, $S = V\*sin(45)t-(1/2)gt^2$ where g is gravitational acceleration of $32.2 ft/s^2$.



Use an array to calculate $V$ for

| 15 | 30 | 60 | 30 | [degrees] |

# Problem 3:

If an ice cream cone is ```6 inches``` tall, and its rim has a diameter of ```2 inches```, determine the weight of
the ice cream that can fit in the cone. Assume that a gallon of ice cream weighs ```8 pounds``` and ```7.5 gallons  occupy 1 cubic foot```.
The volume of a cone is $V = (1/3)Ï€r^2h$ and the volume of a hemisphere is half that of a sphere.

> \[!NOTE]\
> assume that the ice cream above the cone is a perfect hemisphere, and neglect
the thickness of the cone material
