# Homework 2 Prompt:

### Problem 1:

You are given two sides of a triangle,

|   a   |  4.5   |
|:-----:|:------:|
| **b** | **6**  |
| **C** | **35** |

where **a** and **b** are the lengths of the sides and **C** is the angle between them. Write a script to
find the length of the third side and the area of the triangle.



It will be helpful to know the law of cosines and the formula for the area of a triangle.

### Problem 2:

A batter in baseball makes perfect contact with the ball, sending it up at a ```45-degree``` angle toward the fence `400 feet` away.

**a.** Write a script to determine how fast he must hit the ball to land at the base of the fence, neglecting air
resistance.

**b.** Perform a brief experiment to determine whether there was a bet

It will be helpful to know some easy physics. Distance = rate * time.
The horizontal distance, D = the horizontal component of the rate * time, or using symbols,  ```D = V*cosd(45)*t```.
The vertical distance, ```S = V*sind(45)*t-(1/2)*g*t^2``` where g is the gravitational acceleration of ```32.2 ft/s^2```.
Finally, recognize that the vertical distance, S, equals zero when the ball returns to the ground. which to hit
the ball.

Use an array to calculate V for

| 15 | 30 | 60 | 30 | [degrees] |

### Problem 3:

If an ice cream cone is ```6 inches``` tall, and its rim has a diameter of ```2 inches```, write a script to determine the weight of
the ice cream that can fit in the cone, assuming that the ice cream above the cone is a perfect hemisphere. You may neglect
the thickness of the cone material. Assume that a gallon of ice cream weighs ```8 pounds``` and ```7.5 gallons occupy 1 cubic foot```.
The volume of a cone is ```V = (1/3)*pi*(r^2)*h``` and the volume of a hemisphere is half that of a sphere.
