This is a set of simple matrix manipulations.
a. Create a five by six matrix, A, that contains random numbers between 0 and 10.
b. Create a six by five matrix, B, that contains random numbers between 0 and 10.
c. Find the inverse of matrix A*B and store it in the variable, C.
d. Without iteration, create a new matrix D that is the same as A except that all values less
than 5 are replaced by zero.
e. Using iteration, create a new matrix F that is the same as A except that all values less
than 5 are replaced by zero.
f. Create a new matrix G that is the matrix A with the columns reversed.
2) Imagine that world leaders have decided to come up with a single currency for the world. This
   new currency, called the Eullar, is defined by the following:
   Seven dollars and 3 Euros make 71 Eullars.
   One dollar and 2 Euros make 20 Eullars.
   You are a reputed economist, and your job is to find out the value of a dollar in terms of Eullars.
