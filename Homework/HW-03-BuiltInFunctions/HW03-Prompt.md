# Homework 3 Prompt:
### Problem 1:
```P = P_0*e^(r*t)```
where:

|    P    |     current population     |
|:-------:|:--------------------------:|
| **P_0** |  **original population**   |
|  **r**  | **continuous growth rate** |
|  **t**  |          **time**          |
If you originally have 100 rabbits that breed at a continuous growth rate of 90% per year, find how many rabbits 
you will have at the end of 10 years.
### Problem 2:
In cryptography very large prime numbers are used. How many prime numbers are there between 10,000 and 20,000? 
(these prime numbers are not large enough to be used in cryptography).
### Problem 3:
The vector:
**C =** 

| 68 | 83 | 61 | 70 | 75 | 82 | 57 | 5 | 76 | 85 | 62 | 71 | 96 | 78 | 76 | 68 | 72 | 75 | 83 | 93 |

represents the distribution of grades in a dynamic course. Compute the mean, median, mode and standard deviation of 
**C** Which better represents the "most typical grade," the mean, median or mode? Why?
Determine the number of grades in **C** and sort them in ascending order.
