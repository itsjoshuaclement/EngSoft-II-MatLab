$P = P_0*e^rt$
where:

|    $P$    |     current population     |
|:---------:|:--------------------------:|
| **$P_0$** |  **original population**   |
|  **$r$**  | **continuous growth rate** |
|  **$t$**  |          **time**          |

you originally have 100 rabbits that breed at a continuous growth rate of 90% per year, find how many rabbits 
you will have at the end of 10 years.
# Problem 2:
In cryptography very large prime numbers are used. How many prime numbers are there between 10,000 and 20,000? 

# Problem 3:

$$  C = \begin{bmatrix}
68 & 83 & 61 & 70 & 75 & 82 & 57 & 5 & 76 & 85 & 62 & 71 & 96 & 78 & 76 & 68 & 72 & 75 & 83 & 93 \\
\end{bmatrix} $$

represents the distribution of grades in a dynamic course. Compute the mean, median, mode and standard deviation of 
**`C`** Which better represents the "most typical grade," the mean, median or mode? Why?
Determine the number of grades in **`C`** and sort them in ascending order.
