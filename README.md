# EngSoft-II-MatLab
### TEMP readme
This is here to help students/contribute to self-learning and exploration into code! 

## about the course
in this course there is two main folders you will see. **Labs**, and **Homework**.

in the lab folder you will learn the necessary functions and ideas needed to complete the labs and homework. thus the code explanations will be very in-depth discussing the purpose of each function. and the logic behind it. 

while the homework folder is more about the logic and general purpose of the lines of code. 

### what files will be used?
**homework:**
Code.m, this is the solution for the prompt
ANS.md, this is the explanation of the code
and prompt.md and this is the prompt of the question. 

**Labs:** first 3 are the same as the homework. but for labs instead. so more detail. 
Code.m
Prompt.md
ANS.md
learn.md this is where we talk about the specific functions and ideas used for the homework and labs. now each homework and lab builds upon the previous homework's and labs.
